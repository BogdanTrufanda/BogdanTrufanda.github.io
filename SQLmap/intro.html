            <b>Sqlmap<b> is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad range of switches lasting from database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, to accessing the underlying file system and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.
            
            Features:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Full support for six SQL injection techniques: boolean-based blind, time-based blind, error-based, UNION query, stacked queries and out-of-band.
            </li><li>Support to enumerate users, password hashes, privileges, roles, databases, tables and columns.
            </li><li>Automatic recognition of password hash formats and support for cracking them using a dictionary-based attack.
            </li><li>Support to dump database tables entirely, a range of entries or specific columns as per user’s choice. The user can also choose to dump only a range of characters from each column’s entry.
            </li><li>Support to download and upload any file from the database server underlying file system when the database software is MySQL, PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server.
            </li><li>Support to establish an out-of-band stateful TCP connection between the attacker machine and the database server underlying operating system.
            </li></ul>
            <p>
            Sqlmap is able to detect and exploit five different SQL injection types:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Boolean-based blind:</b> sqlmap replaces or appends to the affected parameter in the HTTP request, a syntatically valid SQL statement string containing a SELECT sub-statement, or any other SQL statement whose the user want to retrieve the output.
            </li><li><b>Time-based blind:</b> sqlmap replaces or appends to the affected parameter in the HTTP request, a syntatically valid SQL statement string containing a query which put on hold the back-end DBMS to return for a certain number of seconds.
            </li><li><b>Error-based:</b> sqlmap replaces or appends to the affected parameter a database-specific error message provoking statement and parses the HTTP response headers and body in search of DBMS error messages containing the injected pre-defined chain of characters and the subquery statement output within. 
            </li><li><b>UNION query-based:</b> sqlmap appends to the affected parameter a syntactically valid SQL statement starting with an UNION ALL SELECT.
            </li><li><b>Stacked queries</b>, also known as piggy backing: sqlmap tests if the web application supports stacked queries and then, in case it does support, it appends to the affected parameter in the HTTP request, a semi-colon (;) followed by the SQL statement to be executed</ul>
