         John the Ripper is a popular password cracker that is capable of brute-force using both the CPU and the video card and supports many algorithms. To be more precise, this is an offline brute-forcer (online brute-forcers perform the attack by connecting to network services, and offline crackers work with captured hashes (files) to which they guess a password).John the Ripper jumbo supports hundreds of hash and cipher types, including for: user passwords of Unix flavors (Linux, *BSD, Solaris, AIX, QNX, etc.), macOS, Windows, "web apps" (e.g., WordPress), groupware (e.g., Notes/Domino), and database servers (SQL, LDAP, etc.); network traffic captures (Windows network authentication, WiFi WPA-PSK, etc.); encrypted private keys (SSH, GnuPG, cryptocurrency wallets, etc.), filesystems and disks (macOS .dmg files and "sparse bundles", Windows BitLocker, etc.), archives (ZIP, RAR, 7z), and document files (PDF, Microsoft Office's, etc.) These are just some of the examples - there are many more.

         John the Ripper is very similar with Hashcat but they are still different and below you will find out why:
      </p>
      <ul style="font-size:140%;">
         <li>
            Hashcat can use a video card, CPU, or both for brute-force. John the Ripper can use one thing: either the video card, or the video core of the CPU, or only the CPU. 
         </li>
         <li>
            Hashcat can use the graphics card to crack any supported algorithms. John the Ripper for GPU Cracking only supports certain kinds of algorithms. 
         </li>
         <li>
            If you have several video cards, Hashcat out of the box supports working with multiple devices at once and by default splits the task into the required number of threads and the size of each task is tied to the performance of the video card. John the Ripper can work with multiple graphics cards, but by default, splitting a task across multiple graphics cards is only supported for one algorithm. 
         </li>
         <li>
            It does not matter to Hashcat how you installed it: built from source or downloaded a binary file. It is very important for John the Ripper to compile the binary himself, as the compilation considers the specifics of your system. As a result, during compilation, the instruction sets supported by the processor will be indicated, for example, AVX2 instead of the default AVX, which will have a very significant impact on performance – for some algorithms, this will speed up brute-forcing by 2 times! Alternatively, John's binaries compiled on newer hardware may not work on some computers. 
         </li>
         <li>
            For Hashcat, you must specify the hash type. John the Ripper determines the hash itself, or you can explicitly specify the hash format. 
         </li>
         <li>
            The syntax for commands and options varies greatly.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">John the Ripper can be downloaded from Openwall’s Website or from the Official John the Ripper repository.</p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">John the Ripper is part of Owl, Debian GNU/Linux, Fedora Linux, Gentoo Linux, Mandriva Linux, SUSE Linux, and a number of other Linux distributions. It is in the ports/packages collections of FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD. </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">John the Ripper comes pre-installed in Linux Kali and can be run from the terminal using the following command: </p>
      <center>
         <p style="font-size:160%;">user@kali:~#john</p>
