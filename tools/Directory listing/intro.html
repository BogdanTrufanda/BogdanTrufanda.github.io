        <p>
            Wfuzz is a tool designed for bruteforcing Web Applications, it can be used for finding resources not linked (directories, servlets, scripts, etc), bruteforce GET and POST parameters for checking different kind of injections (SQL, XSS, LDAP,etc), bruteforce Forms parameters (User/Password), Fuzzing,etc.

            Some features:
        </p>
        <ul>
                <li>Multiple Injection points capability with multiple dictionaries
                    <li>Recursion (When doing directory bruteforce)
                        <li>Post, headers and authentication data brute forcing
                            <li>Output to HTML
                                <li>Colored output
                                    <li>Hide results by return code, word numbers, line numbers, regex
                                        <li>Cookies fuzzing
                                            <li>Multi threading
                                                <li>Proxy support
                                                    <li>SOCK support
                <li>Time delays between requests
                <li>Authentication support (NTLM, Basic)
                    <li>All parameters bruteforcing (POST and GET)
                        <li>Multiple encoders per payload
                            <li>Payload combinations with iterators
                                <li>Baseline request (to filter results against)
                                    <li>Brute force HTTP methods
                                        <li>Multiple proxy support (each request through a different proxy)
                                            <li>HEAD scan (faster for resource discovery)
                                                <li>Dictionaries tailored for known applications (Weblogic, Iplanet, Tomcat, Domino, Oracle 9i, Vignette, Coldfusion and many more

            <p>DirBuster is a multi threaded java application designed to brute force directories and files names on web/application servers. Often is the case now of what looks like a web server in a state of default installation is actually not, and has pages and applications hidden within. DirBuster attempts to find these. However tools of this nature are often as only good as the directory and file list they come with. A different approach was taken to generating this. The list was generated from scratch, by crawling the Internet and collecting the directory and files that are actually used by developers! DirBuster comes a total of 9 different lists, this makes DirBuster extremely effective at finding those hidden files and directories. And if that was not enough DirBuster also has the option to perform a pure brute force, which leaves the hidden directories and files nowhere to hide.</p>
        <h1 class="titlu">Gobuster</h1>
        <p>
            Gobuster is a tool used to brute-force:

            URIs (directories and files) in web site and
            DNS subdomains (with wildcard support). Key features are:
    </p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
            <li>No "fat" Java GUI (only terminal).
                <li>can brute force folders and multiple extensions at once.
                    <li>is compiled native on multiple platforms.
                        <li>faster than an interpreted script (such as Python).
                            <li>don`t require a runtime.
                                <li>Programming language that is good with concurrency (Golang).
        </ul>
