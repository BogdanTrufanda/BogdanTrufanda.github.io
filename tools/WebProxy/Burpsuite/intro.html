    <p>
        Burp Suite is one of the most popular tool among professional web app security researchers and bug bounty
        hunters. “Burp,” as it is commonly known, is a proxy-based tool used to evaluate the security of web-based
        applications and do hands-on testing. Its ease of use makes it a more suitable choice over free alternatives
        like OWASP ZAP.

        Burp Suite contains various tools for performing different testing tasks. The tools operate effectively
        together, and you can pass interesting requests between tools as your work progresses, to carry out different
        actions.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Target - This tool contains detailed information about your target applications, and lets you drive the
            process of testing for vulnerabilities.
        </li>
        <li>Proxy - This is an intercepting web proxy that operates as a man-in-the-middle between the end browser and
            the target web application. It lets you intercept, inspect and modify the raw traffic passing in both
            directions.
        </li>
        <li>Intruder - This is a powerful tool for carrying out automated customized attacks against web applications.
            It is highly configurable and can be used to perform a wide range of tasks to make your testing faster and
            more effective.
        </li>
        <li>Repeater - This is a tool for manually manipulating and reissuing individual HTTP requests, and analyzing
            the application's responses.
        </li>
        <li>Sequencer - This is a sophisticated tool for analyzing the quality of randomness in an application's session
            tokens or other important data items that are intended to be unpredictable.
        </li>
        <li>Decoder - This is a useful tool for performing manual or intelligent decoding and encoding of application
            data.
        </li>
        <li>Comparer - This is a handy utility for performing a visual "diff" between any two items of data, such as
            pairs of similar HTTP messages.
        </li>
        <li>Extender - This lets you load Burp extensions, to extend Burp's functionality using your own or third-party
            code.
        </li>
        <li>Clickbandit - This is a tool for generating Clickjacking attacks.
        </li>
        <li>Mobile Assistant - This is a tool to facilitate testing of mobile apps with Burp Suite.</li>
    </ul>
