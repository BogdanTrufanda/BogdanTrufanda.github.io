        <p>
            Medusa is a speedy, parallel, and modular, login brute-forcer. The goal of medusa is to brute-force credentials in as many protocols as possible which eventually lead to remote code execution. It currently has over 21 modules, some of which are: CVS, FTP, HTTP, IMAP, MS-SQL, MySQL, NCP (NetWare), PcAnywhere, POP3, PostgreSQL, rexec, rlogin, rsh, SMB, SMTP (VRFY), SNMP, SSHv2, SVN, Telnet, VmAuthd, VNC and a generic wrapper module.
            
            Taking a closer look at Medusa, we can highlight three features that in my opinion are some of the key features of Medusa. These are:
        </p>
            <ul>

            <li>Thread-based parallel testing — Refers to the possibility of brute-force testing against multiple hosts, users or passwords concurrently.</li>
            
            <li>Flexible user input — Refers to using target user information (host/user/password) that you have collected on your information gathering stage and use that info as an input that helps medusa do a more defined than broad brute-forcing on the target/s.</li>
            
            <li>Modular design — An interesting function of medusa is each service module exists as an independent .mod file. This means that no modifications are necessary to the core application in order to extend the supported list of services for brute-forcing.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Hydra is a parallelized login cracker which supports numerous protocols to attack. It is very fast and flexible, and new modules are easy to add. This tool makes it possible for researchers and security consultants to show how easy it would be to gain unauthorized access to a system remotely.

        It supports: Cisco AAA, Cisco auth, Cisco enable, CVS, FTP, HTTP(S)-FORM-GET, HTTP(S)-FORM-POST, HTTP(S)-GET, HTTP(S)-HEAD, HTTP-Proxy, ICQ, IMAP, IRC, LDAP, MS-SQL, MySQL, NNTP, Oracle Listener, Oracle SID, PC-Anywhere, PC-NFS, POP3, PostgreSQL, RDP, Rexec, Rlogin, Rsh, SIP, SMB(NT), SMTP, SMTP Enum, SNMP v1+v2+v3, SOCKS5, SSH (v1 and v2), SSHKEY, Subversion, Teamspeak (TS2), Telnet, VMware-Auth, VNC and XMPP.
