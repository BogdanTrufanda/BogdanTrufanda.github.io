<p>The purpose of this framework is to replicate the already existing tools out there, in order to fully understand and explain the processes behind the scene. At this moment.
    the framework consist of six attack vectors. These are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Login HTTP brute forcer</li>
    <pre>* replicates ZAP proxy / Burpsuite tools *</pre>
    <li>Directory bruteforcer</li>
    <pre>* replicates Wfuzz / Dirbuster / Gobuster  tools *</pre>
    <li>Password cracker</li>
    <pre>* replicates John the ripper/ Hashcat tools *</pre>
    <li>OSINT</li>
    <pre>* Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is a multi-methods (qualitative, quantitative) methodology for collecting,
analyzing and making decisions about data accessible in publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context. *</pre>
    <li>Forged JWT</li>
    <pre>* JSON Web Token is an Internet standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload holds JSON that asserts
some number of claims. The tokens are signed either using a private secret or a public/private key. For example, a server could generate a token that 
has the claim "logged in as admin" and provide that to a client. The client could then use that token to prove that it is logged in as admin *</pre>
    <li>Vulnerable components</li>
    <pre>* Some vulnerable components (e.g., framework libraries) can be identified and exploited with automated tools, expanding the threat agent pool beyond 
targeted attackers to include chaotic actors. Virtually every application has these issues because most development teams don't focus on ensuring their 
components/libraries are up to date. In many cases, the developers don't even know all the components they are using,
never mind their versions. Component dependencies make things even worse. *</pre>
    <li>...</li>
    <pre>* ... *</pre>
</ul>
