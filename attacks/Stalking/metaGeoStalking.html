    <p>
        Who would have guessed that a simple walk in the park could lead to an account compromise. People these days are
        not
        careful with what they post online and are not aware of the possible consequences it can have when people
        exploit that.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make use of tools that can inspect the metadata of images. </li>
        <li>Use this information to answer the security question of the John, who enjoys hiking in the park.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Steps:
    </p>
    <ul>

        <li>Go to the photo wall and search for the photo that has been posted by the user j0hNny.
        </li>Download that photo.
        </li>
        <li>Check the metadata of the photo.
        </li>
        <li>When viewing the metadata, you can see the coordinates of where the photo was taken. The coordinates are
            36.958717N 84.348217W
        </li>
        <li>Search for these coordinates on Google to find out in which forest the photo was taken. It can be seen that
            the Daniel Boone National Forest is located on these coordinates.
        </li>
        <li>Go to the login page and click on Forgot your password?.
