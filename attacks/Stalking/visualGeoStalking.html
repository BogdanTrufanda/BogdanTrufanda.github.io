    <p>
        It is also possible to determine where a picture was taken by looking at visual clues within the image. A
        certain user has
        uploaded a picture of his old workplace. Take a look at what his security question is and see if you can find
        the answer
        by looking at his uploaded image.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Look at visual clues to determine what company is shown in the picture and use that to answer the security
            question.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Steps:
    </p>
    <ul>

        <li>Go to the photo wall and search for the photo that has been posted by the user <i>E=maÂ²</i>.
        </li>
        <li>Open the image so that you can zoom in on it.
        </li>
        <li>On the far left window on the middle floor, you can see a logo of a company. It can be seen that logo shows
            the name ITsec.
        </li>
        <li>Go to the login page and click on Forgot your password?.
        </li>
        <li>Fill in emma@juice-sh.op as the email and ITsec as the answer of the security question.
        </li>
        <li>Choose a new password and click on Change.</li>
