  <p>
    Stalking is unwanted and/or repeated surveillance by an individual or group toward another person. Stalking
    behaviors are interrelated to harassment and intimidation and may include following the victim in person or
    monitoring them. The term stalking is used with some differing definitions in psychiatry and psychology, as well as
    in some legal jurisdictions as a term for a criminal offense.

    According to a 2002 report by the U.S. National Center for Victims of Crime, "virtually any unwanted contact between
    two people that directly or indirectly communicates a threat or places the victim in fear can be considered
    stalking", although in practice the legal standard is usually somewhat stricter.

    Banking information: account numbers, credit card numbers.
    Health information.
    Personal information: SSN/SIN, date of birth, etc.
    User account/passwords.

    Causing:
