    <h1>CAPTCHA</h1>

  <p>
    <b>CAPTCHA:</b>

    CAPTCHA is an acronym for “Computer Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans apart”. It is used to
    determine whether or not the user is human.

    Many times, a CAPTCHA is an image. A human has to solve it using the challenge response system. A human can usually
    read it without too much difficulty. Figure below is an example of a CAPTCHA. The user has to prove that he is not a
    robot by writing the characters of image as an answer to the CAPTCHA. If it is correct, then the application accepts
    the action (login, registration, forgot password). If the answer is wrong then the user is stopped at that point and
    is presented with a new CAPTCHA until he answers correctly.
  </p>
  <p>
    The overwhelming benefit of CAPTCHA is that it is highly effective against all but the most sophisticated bad bots.
    However, CAPTCHA mechanisms can negatively affect the user experience on your website:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Disruptive and frustrating for users
    </li>May be difficult to understand or use for some audiences
    </li>
    <li>Some CAPTCHA types do not support all browsers
    </li>
    <li>Some CAPTCHA types are not accessible to users who view a website using screen readers or assistive devices</li>
  </ul>

    <b>Whitelist Bypass:</b>

    Whitelisting is the practice of explicitly allowing some identified entities access to a particular privilege,
    service, mobility, access or recognition. It is the opposite of blacklisting.
