    <p>
        The Contact Us form for customer feedback contains a CAPTCHA to protect it from being abused through scripting.
        This challenge is about beating this automation protection.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You could prepare 10 browser tabs, solving every CAPTCHA and filling out the each feedback form. Then you'd
            need to very quickly switch through the tabs and submit the forms in under 10 seconds total.</li>
        <li>Should the Juice Shop ever decide to change the challenge into "Submit 100 or more customer feedbacks within
            60 seconds" or worse, you'd probably have a hard time keeping up with any tab-switching approach.</li>
        <li>Investigate closely how the CAPTCHA mechanism works and try to find either a bypass or some automated way of
            solving it dynamically.</li>
        <li>Wrap this into a script (in whatever programming language you prefer) that repeats this 10 times.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Steps:
    </p>
    <ul>

        <li>Open the Network tab of your browser DevTools and visit http://aset2020.herokuapp.com/#/contact
        </li>
        <li>You should notice a GET request to http://aset2020.herokuapp.com/rest/captcha/ which retrieves the CAPTCHA for the
            feedback form. The HTTP response body will look similar to
            {"captchaId":18,"captcha":"5*8*8","answer":"320"}.
        </li>
        <li>Fill out the form normally and submit it while checking the backend interaction in your Developer Tools. The
            CAPTCHA identifier and solution are transmitted along with the feedback in the request body: {comment:
            "Hello", rating: 1, captcha: "320", captchaId: 18}
        </li>
        <li>You will notice that a new CAPTCHA is retrieved from the REST endpoint. It will present a different math
            challenge, e.g. {"captchaId":19,"captcha":"1*1-1","answer":"0"}
        </li>
        <li>Write another feedback but before sending it, change the captchaId and captcha parameters to the previous
            values of captchaId and answer. In this example you would submit captcha: "320", captchaId: 18 instead of
            captcha: "0", captchaId: 19.
        </li>
        <li>The server will accept your feedback, telling your that the CAPTCHA can be pinned to any previous one you
            like.
        </li>
        <li>Write a script with a 10-iteration loop that submits feedback using your pinned captchaId and captcha
            parameters. Running this script will solve the challenge.
        </li>
    </ul>
