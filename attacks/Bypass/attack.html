        <h1>Advantages implementing Whitelists & CAPTCHAs </h1>
    </div>
    <p>
        CAPTCHAs have several applications for practical security, including (but not limited to):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Preventing Comment Spam in Blogs. </li>
        <li>Protecting Website Registration </li>
        <li>Protecting Email Addresses From Scrapers.. </li>
        <li>Online Polls. </li>
        <li>Preventing Dictionary Attacks. </li>
        <li>Preventing Worms and Spam. </li>

    </ul>

    <p>Here are the benefits of using an application whitelisting:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            You can spot right away any unknown program running in your network or system. Looking at the whitelist you
            can
            say when a program is a threat or not. If it is not listed then, it is not allowed. SecureBox will help you
            simplify the application whitelisting process. SecureBox also has an arsenal of reporting systems:
        </li>

        <li>
            Another benefit of using application whitelisting is that it blocks most malware attacks. Would your network
            administrator list Petya ransomware on the whitelist? Of course not! So by default, this kind of malware
            attack
            is already countered before it makes any damage.
        </li>

        <li>
            SecureBox is also a good antimalware program. It prevents, detects, and removes malicious software in your
            system. SecureBox defeats the following threats.
        </li>
        <li>
            Another benefit of using application whitelisting is that improves productivity at work. Your employees will
            have access only to client-approved applications. This means their focus would only be towards work. They
            are
            not distracted by other applications.
        </li>
    </ul>
