         What is Broken Access Control?
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
	 Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification or destruction of all data, or performing a business function outside of the limits of the user. Common access control vulnerabilities include:
      </p>
      <ul style="font-size:140%;">
	<li>
	Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL, internal application state, or the HTML page, or simply using a custom API attack tool. 
	</li>
	<li>
	Allowing the primary key to be changed to another's users record, permitting viewing or editing someone else's account.  
	</li>
	<li>
        Elevation of privilege. Acting as a user without being logged in, or acting as an admin when logged in as a user.  
	</li>
	<li>
	Metadata manipulation, such as replaying or tampering with a JSON Web Token (JWT) access control token or a cookie or hidden field manipulated to elevate privileges, or abusing JWT invalidation.  
	</li>
	<li>
	CORS misconfiguration allows unauthorized API access..  
	</li>
        <li>
	Force browsing to authenticated pages as an unauthenticated user or to privileged pages as a standard user. Accessing API with missing access controls for POST, PUT and DELETE.  
	</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
	 One specific type of access control problem is administrative interfaces that allow site administrators to manage a site over the Internet. Such features are frequently used to allow site administrators to efficiently manage users, data, and content on their site. In many instances, sites support a variety of administrative roles to allow finer granularity of site administration. Due to their power, these interfaces are frequently prime targets for attack by both outsiders and insiders.
