           How to construct a CSRF attack
        </p>
								<p style="font-size:160%;">
             Manually creating the HTML needed for a CSRF exploit can be cumbersome, particularly where the desired request contains a large number of parameters, or there are other quirks in the request. The easiest way to construct a CSRF exploit is using the CSRF PoC generator that is built in to Burp Suite Professional:  
        </p>
									<ul style="font-size:140%;">
										<li>
           	 Select a request anywhere in Burp Suite Professional that you want to test or exploit.  
	</li>
										<li>
	         From the right-click context menu, select Engagement tools / Generate CSRF PoC.  
	</li>
										<li>
                 Burp Suite will generate some HTML that will trigger the selected request (minus cookies, which will be added automatically by the victim's browser).  
	</li>
										<li>
	         You can tweak various options in the CSRF PoC generator to fine-tune aspects of the attack. You might need to do this in some unusual situations to deal with quirky features of requests.  
	</li>
										<li>
	         Copy the generated HTML into a web page, view it in a browser that is logged in to the vulnerable web site, and test whether the intended request is issued successfully and the desired action occurs.  
	</li>
									</ul>

           How to deliver a CSRF exploit
        </p>
								<p style="font-size:160%;">
              The delivery mechanisms for cross-site request forgery attacks are essentially the same as for reflected XSS. Typically, the attacker will place the malicious HTML onto a web site that they control, and then induce victims to visit that web site. This might be done by feeding the user a link to the web site, via an email or social media message. Or if the attack is placed into a popular web site (for example, in a user comment), they might just wait for users to visit the web site.  
        </p>
								<p style="font-size:160%;">
              Note that some simple CSRF exploits employ the GET method and can be fully self-contained with a single URL on the vulnerable web site. In this situation, the attacker may not need to employ an external site, and can directly feed victims a malicious URL on the vulnerable domain. In the preceding example, if the request to change email address can be performed with the GET method.
