        <ul>
            <li>1) Tampering with the Signing Algorithm:
            </li>
            <p>‘none’ algorithm: JWT supports the usage of ‘none’ algorithm for use-cases where the integrity of the claim within JWT is already verified by other means. This algorithm allows the server to issue a JWT without a signature. The content within a token issued with a ‘none’ algorithm will look like the following:

                {“alg”:”none”,”typ”: “JWT”}.{“sub”:”1234567890″,”name”:”John Doe”,”iat”: 1516239022}.              
               Attackers can use this feature to set the algorithm in their token to ‘none’ and provide an empty signature to fool the server into accepting it as a valid token. However, most of the modern implementations now have an added security check that rejects tokens set with ‘none’ algorithm when a secret-key was used to issue them.
               
               RS256 to HS256: JWT supports the usage of asymmetric signing algorithms such as RS256 which uses a private key to sign the token and a public key to verify the signature. The private key is only known to the server and the public key is accessible to everyone.
               
               The use of asymmetric signing algorithms is useful in situations where 3rd party clients need to verify the validity of a JWT not issued by them. A server signing JWTs with a symmetric algorithm such as HS256 will have to share the secret-key with all the 3rd party clients that want verify the token. This increases the risk of secret-key being disclosed.
               
               In insecure implementations where the server trusts the data inside the header of a JWT and doesn’t validate the algorithm it used to issue a token, attackers can change the algorithm from ‘RS256’ to ‘HS256’ and use the ‘public’ key to generate a HMAC signature for the token. The server will now treat this token as one generated with ‘HS256’ algorithm and use its public key to decode and verify it.
            </p>
            <li>2) Brute-Forcing HS256:
                <p>JWTs signed with HS256 algorithm could be vulnerable to secret-key disclosure. that usually happens through brute-force attacks, especially for weak keys. Since a client does not need to interact with the server to check the validity of secret-key after a token is issued by the server, attackers can conduct offline brute-force attacks against the token by using wordlists of possible secret-keys.   

                    It is recommended to use sufficiently long (256 bit) keys to safeguard against these attacks.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>3) Sensitive Information disclosure:
            </li>
            <p>All the information inside the payload is stored in plain text. It is important not to leak sensitive information such as internal IP addresses through the tokens.  

                Attacks against JWT arise from bad implementations and using outdated libraries. To benefit from the security features JWT offers, follow the best practices for implementing them, only use up-to-date and secure libraries and choose the right algorithm for your use-case. </p>
