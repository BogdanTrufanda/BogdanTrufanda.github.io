            Reset Uvogin's password via the Forgot Password mechanism.  
           </p>
           <ul>
           <li>
            To reset Uvogin's password, you need the to find out what his favorite movie is in order to answer his security question. This is the kind of information that people often carelessly expose online. </li>
            <li>People often tend to reuse aliases on different websites. Sherlock is a great tool for finding social media accounts with known aliases/pseudonyms.</li>
            <li>Trying out a few variations of the alias uvogin, uv0gin leads us to a twitter account with a similarly written tweet which references a vulnerable beverage store. However nothing about his favorite movie.</li>
            <li>The WayBack can be used to check for older versions of their profile page to look for deleted tweets. And indeed, one of the snapshots available on WayBack contains a deleted tweet that references Silence of the Lambs which is infact the correct answer to his security question.</li>
