    <h1>SQL Injection</h1>

  <p>
    Injection flaws allow attackers to relay malicious code through an application to another system. These attacks
    include calls to the operating system via system calls, the use of external programs via shell commands, as well as
    calls to backend databases via SQL (i.e., SQL injection). Whole scripts written in Perl, Python, and other languages
    can be injected into poorly designed applications and executed. Any time an application uses an interpreter of any
    type there is a danger of introducing an injection vulnerability.

    Many web applications use operating system features and external programs to perform their functions. Sendmail is
    probably the most frequently invoked external program, but many other programs are used as well. When a web
    application passes information from an HTTP request through as part of an external request, it must be carefully
    scrubbed. Otherwise, the attacker can inject special (meta) characters, malicious commands, or command modifiers
    into the information and the web application will blindly pass these on to the external system for execution.
  </p>
  <p>
    SQL injection is a particularly widespread and dangerous form of injection. To exploit a SQL injection flaw, the
    attacker must find a parameter that the web application passes through to a database. By carefully embedding
    malicious SQL commands into the content of the parameter, the attacker can trick the web application into forwarding
    a malicious query to the database. These attacks are not difficult to attempt and more tools are emerging that scan
    for these flaws. The consequences are particularly damaging, as an attacker can obtain, corrupt, or destroy database
    contents.
  </p><p>
    Injection vulnerabilities can be very easy to discover and exploit, but they can also be extremely obscure. The
    consequences of a successful injection attack can also run the entire range of severity, from trivial to complete
    system compromise or destruction. In any case, the use of external calls is quite widespread, so the likelihood of
    an application having an injection flaw should be considered high.1
