        <h1>Prevent SQL Injection</h1>
    </div>
    <p>

        The most important precautions are data sanitization and validation, which should already be in place.
        Sanitization usually involves running any submitted data through a function (such as MySQL's
        mysql_real_escape_string() function) to ensure that any dangerous characters (like " ' ") are not passed to a
        SQL query in data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Validation is slightly different, in that it attempts to ensure that the data submitted is in the form that is
        expected. At the most basic level this includes ensuring that e-mail addresses contain an "@" sign, that only
        digits are supplied when integer data is expected, and that the length of a piece of data submitted is not
        longer than the maximum expected length. Validation is often carried out in two ways: by blacklisting dangerous
        or unwanted characters (although hackers can often get around blacklists) and by whitelisting only those
        characters that are allowed in a given circumstance, which can involve more work on the part of the programmer.
        Although validation may take place on the client side, hackers can modify or get around this, so it's essential
        that you also validate all data on the server side as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        But sanitization and validation are far from the whole story. Here are ten ways you can help prevent or mitigate
        SQL injection attacks:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Trust no-one: Assume all user-submitted data is evil and validate and sanitize everything.
        </li>
        <li>Don't use dynamic SQL when it can be avoided: used prepared statements, parameterized queries or stored
            procedures instead whenever possible.
        </li>
        <li>Update and patch: vulnerabilities in applications and databases that hackers can exploit using SQL injection
            are
            regularly discovered, so it's vital to apply patches and updates as soon as practical.
        </li>
        <li>Firewall: Consider a web application firewall (WAF) – either software or appliance based – to help filter
            out
            malicious data. Good ones will have a comprehensive set of default rules, and make it easy to add new ones
            whenever necessary. A WAF can be particularly useful to provide some security protection against a
            particular
            new vulnerability before a patch is available.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce your attack surface: Get rid of any database functionality that you don't need to prevent a hacker
            taking
            advantage of it. For example, the xp_cmdshell extended stored procedure in MS SQL spawns a Windows command
            shell
            and passes in a string for execution, which could be very useful indeed for a hacker. The Windows process
            spawned by xp_cmdshellhas the same security privileges as the SQL Server service account.
        </li>
        <li>Use appropriate privileges:don't connect to your database using an account with admin-level privileges
            unless
            there is some compelling reason to do so. Using a limited access account is far safer, and can limit what a
            hacker is able to do.
        </li>
        <li>Keep your secrets secret:Assume that your application is not secure and act accordingly by encrypting or
            hashing
            passwords and other confidential data including connection strings.
        </li>
        <li>Don't divulge more information than you need to:hackers can learn a great deal about database architecture
            from
            error messages, so ensure that they display minimal information. Use the "RemoteOnly" customErrors mode (or
            equivalent) to display verbose error messages on the local machine while ensuring that an external hacker
            gets
            nothing more than the fact that his actions resulted in an unhandled error.
        </li>
        <li>Don't forget the basics: Change the passwords of application accounts into the database regularly. This is
            common sense, but in practice these passwords often stay unchanged for months or even years.
        </li>
        <li>Buy better software: Make code writers responsible for checking the code and for fixing security flaws in
            custom
            applications before the software is delivered. SANS suggests you incorporate terms from this sample contract
            into your agreement with any software vendor.</li>
    </ul>
