        <h1>Order the Christmas special offer of 2014</h1>
    </div>

    <p>
        To solve this challenge you need to order a product that is not supposed to be available any more.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Find out how the application hides deleted products from its customers.</li>
        <li>Try to craft an attack string that makes deleted products visible again.</li>
        <li>You need to get the deleted product into your shopping cart and trigger the Checkout.</li>
        <li>Neither of the above can be achieved through the application frontend and it might even require (half-)Blind SQL Injection.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Steps:
    </p>
    <ul>

        <li>Open http://localhost:3000/#/search and reload the page with F5 while observing the Network tab in your browser's DevTools </li>
        <li>Recognize the GET request http://localhost:3000/rest/products/search?q= which returns the product data. </li>
        <li>Submitting any SQL payloads via the Search field in the navigation bar will do you no good, as it is only applying filters onto 
            the entire data set what was retrieved with a singular call upon loading the page. </li>
        <li>In that light, the q= parameter on the http://localhost:3000/rest/products/search endpoint would not even be needed, but might be 
            a relic from a different implementation of the search functionality. Test this theory by submitting http://localhost:3000/rest/products/search?q=orange 
            which should give you a result such as
            <img src="forStep4.png">
        </li>
        <li>Submit '; as q via http://localhost:3000/rest/products/search?q='; </li>
        <li>You will receive an error page with a SQLITE_ERROR: syntax error mentioned, indicating that SQL Injection is indeed possible.
            <img src="forStep6.png">
        </li>
        <li>You are now in the area of Blind SQL Injection, where trying create valid queries is a matter of patience, observance and a bit of luck. </li>
        <li>Varying the payload into '-- for q results in a SQLITE_ERROR: incomplete input. This error happens due to two (now unbalanced) parenthesis in the query. </li>
        <li>Using '))-- for q fixes the syntax and successfully retrieves all products, including the (logically deleted) Christmas offer. Take note of its id (which should be 10)
            <img src="forStep9.png">
        </li>
        <li>Go to http://localhost:3000/#/login and log in as any user. </li>
        <li>Add any regularly available product into you shopping basket to prevent problems at checkout later. Memorize your BasketId value in the request payload (when viewing 
            the Network tab) or find the same information in the bid variable in your browser's Session Storage (in the Application tab). </li>
        <li>Craft and send a POST request to http://localhost:3000/api/BasketItems with
            {"BasketId": "<Your Basket ID>", "ProductId": 10, "quantity": 1} as body and application/json as Content-Type</li>
        <li>Go to http://localhost:3000/#/basket to verify that the "Christmas Super-Surprise-Box (2014 Edition)" is in the basket. </li>
        <li>Click Checkout on the Your Basket page to solve the challenge./li>
    
    </ul>
