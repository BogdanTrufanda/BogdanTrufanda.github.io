        <p>
            There is no single action you can take to eliminate the threat of DOM-based attacks entirely. However,
            generally speaking, the most effective way to avoid DOM-based vulnerabilities is to avoid allowing data
            from any untrusted source to dynamically alter the value that is transmitted to any sink.

            If the desired functionality of the application means that this behavior is unavoidable, then defenses
            must be implemented within the client-side code. In many cases, the relevant data can be validated on a
            whitelist basis, only allowing content that is known to be safe. In other cases, it will be necessary to
            sanitize or encode the data. This can be a complex task, and depending on the context into which the
            data is to be inserted, may involve a combination of JavaScript escaping, HTML encoding, and URL
            encoding, in the appropriate sequence.
        </p>

            <p>In addition to the general measures described on the DOM-based vulnerabilities page, you should avoid
                allowing data from any untrusted source to dynamically pass data into problematic platform APIs.
