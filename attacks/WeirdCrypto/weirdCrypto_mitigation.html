      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         In order to keep your data safe you have to keep up with the encryption developement and yo use the most powerful encryption algorithms.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Below you can see five of the most used encryption algorithms:
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;font-weight: bold">
         Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the trusted standard algorithm used by the United States government, as well as other organizations. Although extremely efficient in the 128-bit form, AES also uses 192- and 256-bit keys for very demanding encryption purposes. AES is widely considered invulnerable to all attacks except for brute force. Regardless, many internet security experts believe AES will eventually be regarded as the go-to standard for encrypting data in the private sector.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;font-weight: bold">
         Triple DES
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Triple DES is the successor to the original Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, created in response to hackers who figured out how to breach DES. It’s a symmetric encryption that was once the most widely used symmetric algorithm in the industry, though it’s being gradually phased out. TripleDES applies the DES algorithm three times to every data block and is commonly used to encrypt UNIX passwords and ATM PINs.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;font-weight: bold">
         RSA
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         RSA is a public-key encryption asymmetric algorithm and the standard for encrypting information transmitted via the internet. RSA encryption is robust and reliable because it creates a massive bunch of gibberish that frustrates would-be hackers, causing them to expend a lot of time and energy to crack into systems. 
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;font-weight: bold">
         Blowfish
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Blowfish is another algorithm that was designed to replace DES. This symmetric tool breaks messages into 64-bit blocks and encrypts them individually. Blowfish has established a reputation for speed, flexibility, and being unbreakable. It’s in the public domain, so that makes it free, adding even more to its appeal. Blowfish is commonly found on e-commerce platforms, securing payments, and in password management tools.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;font-weight: bold">
         Twofish
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Twofish is Blowfish’s successor. It’s a license-free, symmetric encryption that deciphers 128-bit data blocks. Additionally, Twofish always encrypts data in 16 rounds, no matter what the key size. Twofish is perfect for both software and hardware environments and is considered one of the fastest of its type. Many of today’s file and folder encryption software solutions use this method.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;font-weight: bold">
         Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Rivest-Shamir-Adleman is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that works off the factorization of the product of two large prime numbers. Only a user with knowledge of these two numbers can decode the message successfully. Digital signatures commonly use RSA, but the algorithm slows down when it encrypts large volumes of data.
