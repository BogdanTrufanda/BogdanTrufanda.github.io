         In order to solve the Weird Crypto challenge we need to inform the shop about an algorithm or library it should not use or at least not in the way it does.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Because the request is quite ambiguous we will try to find out more informations.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         We can click on the "Inform the shop" text because we can notice a hyperlink back there and it will take us to a contact form in which we are supposed to send a message. 
      </p>
      <img src="weirdCryptoImage_2.jpg">
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Next, clicking on the Unresolved label at the end of the challenge's text, it will take us to a page which will give us more informations about the challenge and what we are suppose to do.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         In the image above you can see that they are expecting at least one of five possible answers and as the challenge says it should be a weak cryptographic algorithm so since Google knows everything I bet he will know the weakest cryptographic algorithms. Go Google.com and search for it....
      </p>
      <img src="weirdCryptoImage_4.jpg">
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Below you can see the first answer we get from security.stackexchange.com,  and we have to thank them for that, is MD5.
      </p>
      <img src="weirdCryptoImage_5.jpg">
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Finally go to score board and from the Weird Crypto challenge click on the hyperlink to pop up the contact form. 
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Type in MD5 at the comment, give a wonderful 5 star rating and click send. If you look in score board after that, you can see that the weird crypto challenge is done.
