  <p>
    Uploaded files represent a significant risk to applications. The first step in many attacks is to get some code to
    the system to be attacked. Then the attack only needs to find a way to get the code executed. Using a file upload
    helps the attacker accomplish the first step.

    The consequences of unrestricted file upload can vary, including complete system takeover, an overloaded file system
    or database, forwarding attacks to back-end systems, client-side attacks, or simple defacement. It depends on what
    the application does with the uploaded file and especially where it is stored.

  <p>
    There are really two classes of problems here. The first is with the file metadata, like the path and file name.
    These are generally provided by the transport, such as HTTP multi-part encoding. This data may trick the application
    into overwriting a critical file or storing the file in a bad location. You must validate the metadata extremely
    carefully before using it.

    The other class of problem is with the file size or content. The range of problems here depends entirely on what the
    file is used for.
