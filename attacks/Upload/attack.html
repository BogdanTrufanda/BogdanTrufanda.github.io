        <h1>Exploiting Unrestricted File Upload</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>1) Allow Listing File Extensions:
            <p>
                Applications that check the file extensions using an allow list method also need to validate the full
                filename to prevent any bypass.

                The list of permitted extensions should be reviewed as it can contain malicious extensions as well. For
                instance, in case of having “.shtml” in the list, the application can be vulnerable to SSI attacks.
                Some of the bypass techniques for the deny list methods such as using double extensions are also
                applicable
                here and should be checked.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>2) “Content-Type” Header Validation:
            <p>“Content-Type” entity in the header of the request indicates the Internet media type of the message
                content. Sometimes web applications use this parameter in order to recognise a file as a valid one. For
                instance, they only accept the files with the “Content-Type” of “text/plain”.

                It is possible to bypass this protection by changing this parameter in the request header using a web
                proxy.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>3) Sensitive Information disclosure:

            <p>Sometimes web applications intentionally or unintentionally use some functions (or APIs) to check the
                file types in order to process them further. For instance, when an application resize an image file, it
                may just show an error message when non-image files are uploaded without saving them on the server.

                If it reads the few first characters (or headers), it can be bypassed by inserting malicious code after
                some valid header or within the file’s metadata.
                Inserting code in the comments section or those section that have no effect on the main file can also
                lead to a bypass.
                The inserted data can be obfuscated or encoded if the application detects a malicious code using
                specific patterns or signatures.
                Uploaded file can be crafted to create a malicious code in case of being compressed by the application.

        <li>Prevention Methods (Solutions to be more secure):

            <p>In order to make a Windows server more secure, it is very important to follow the folowing
                recommendations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The file types allowed to be uploaded should be restricted to only those that are necessary for
                    business functionality.</li>
                <li>Never accept a filename and its extension directly without having an allow list filter.</li>
                <li>It is necessary to have a list of only permitted extensions on the web application. And, file
                    extension can be selected from the list</li>
                <li>All the control characters and Unicode ones should be removed from the filenames and their
                    extensions without any exception. Also, the special characters such as “;”, “:”, “>”, “<”, “/” ,”\”,
                    additional “.”, “*”, “%”, “$”, and so on should be discarded as well. If it is applicable and
                    there is no need to have Unicode characters, it is highly recommended to only accept
                    Alpha-Numeric characters and only 1 dot as an input for the file name and the extension; in
                    which the file name and also the extension should not be empty at all (regular expression:
                    [a-zA-Z0-9]{1,200}\.[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,10}).</li>
                <li>Limit the filename length. For instance, the maximum length of the name of a file plus its extension
                    should be less than 255 characters (without any directory) in an NTFS partition.</li>
                <li>Limit the file size to a maximum value in order to prevent denial of service attacks (on file space
                    or other web application’s functions such as the image resizer</li>
                <li>Uploaded directory should not have any “execute” permission and all the script handlers should be
                    removed from these directories.</li>
                <li>Use Cross Site Request Forgery protection methods.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
