    <p>
        The client-side validation prevents uploads larger than 100 kB.

        The Juice Shop offers its customers the chance to complain about an order that left them unsatisfied. One of the
        juice bottles might have leaked during transport or maybe the shipment was just two weeks late. To prove their
        claim, customers are supposed to attach their order confirmation document to the online complaint. To prevent
        abuse of this functionality, the application only allows file uploads of 100 kB or less.

        First you should try to understand how the file upload is actually handled on the client and server side
        With this understanding you need to find a "weak spot" in the right place and have to craft an exploit for it


    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Craft a POST request to https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/file-upload with a form parameter file that contains a PDF
            file of more than 100 kB but less than 200 kB. </li>
        <li>The response from the server will be a 204 with no content, but the challenge will be successfully solved.</li>
        <li>Files larger than 200 kB are rejected by an upload size check on server side with a 500 error stating Error:
            File too large.</li>
    </ul>
