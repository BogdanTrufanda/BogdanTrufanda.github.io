	 This challenge is exploiting a Broken Authentication vulnerability so first let's see what is Broken Authentication.

         What Is Broken Authentication?
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
	 Broken authentication is a term for several vulnerabilities that attackers exploit to impersonate legitimate users online. Broadly, broken authentication refers to weaknesses in two areas: session management and credential management. Both are classified as broken authentication because attackers can use either avenue to masquerade as a user: hijacked session IDs or stolen login credentials. 
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Attackers employ a wide variety of strategies to take advantage of these weaknesses, ranging from huge credential stuffing attacks to highly targeted schemes aimed at gaining access to a specific person’s credentials.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         In recent years, broken authentication attacks have accounted for many of the worst data breaches, and security experts sound the alarm about this underrecognized threat. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has included it in its “Top 10” list of the biggest web application security risks since 2017. By 2020, broken authentication had climbed to the number two spot.

        Specifically we have to log into wurstbrot's account by breaking his two factor authentication code and we will see how we can do this in the attack section.
