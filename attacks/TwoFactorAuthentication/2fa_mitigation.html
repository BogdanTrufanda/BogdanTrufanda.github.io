         How to Fix Broken Authentication in Your Organization
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;font-weight: bold">
         Update Session Management
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Every web application automatically ends sessions at some point, either after logout, a period of no activity, or a certain length of time. Tailor your session length to the type of user and the application they’re using.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         A streaming-video service might want their sessions to be weeks long, so users can navigate straight to Netflix without having to log in every time. But a banking app should automatically log users out after a few minutes since the risk of a hijacked session is much higher.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         As we discussed, the best way to prevent session fixation is to issue a user with a new session ID after login. Similarly, sessions and authentication tokens must be immediately invalidated after a session ends, so attackers can’t reuse them. 
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         There are so many ways that URL rewriting can end up exposing session IDs, so your safest bet is not to go that route. Use cookies generated by a secure session manager.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Semantic validation should enforce correctness of their values in the specific business context (e.g. start date is before end date, price is within expected range).  
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;font-weight: bold">
         Tighten Password Policies
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         OWASP’s number one tip for fixing broken authentication is to “implement multi-factor authentication to prevent automated, credential stuffing, brute force, and stolen credential reuse attacks.”
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Given how vulnerable passwords are to credential stuffing and password spraying, it’s clear that they are no longer adequate to secure an account. MFA provides an extra level of security by demanding an additional credential that’s harder for attackers to fake, such as a biometric scan or one-time code.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         When designing your application’s login page, OWASP recommends following NIST guidelines on password length and complexity. They also advise automatically rejecting any of the most common passwords on the web.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Use an identity and access management (IAM) platform that helps you create and implement a password strategy easily. The platform should also provide you with login and signup pages with forms that enforce your password policies. Auth0 Universal Login offers you that secure login infrastructure to authenticate your users to your apps.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         A strong password storage strategy is critical to mitigate data breaches that put the reputation of any organization in danger. Hashing is the foundation of secure password storage. The premise of hashing is simple: given arbitrary input, output a random string of a specific length.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         What's important to highlight is that the hashing operation is irreversible. An attacker cannot determine the original password by looking at the hashed password. However, if two users choose the same password, the hash will be the same. You can add random data to the password to guarantee that the output of the hashing process is unique. This random data is known as a "salt".
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Due to the properties of hashing mentioned above, you don't need to encrypt the hashed password before you store it in the database. When a user attempts to log in, your web application uses the supplied password as input to a hashing function and compares the output to the database value. If the password hashes match, the login is successful.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Hashing with salts can protect you against different attack vectors, such as rainbow table attacks, while slowing down dictionary and brute-force attacks.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Use an identity and access management (IAM) platform that helps you prevent critical identity data from falling into the wrong hands. Auth0 never stores passwords in cleartext. Passwords are always hashed and salted using bcrypt, an industry-grade and battle-tested algorithm. Additionally, Auth0 encrypts both data at rest and in motion. All network communication uses TLS with at least 128-bit AES encryption. Auth0 built state-of-the-art security into its platform to protect your business and your users.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Use an identity and access management (IAM) platform with breached password protection. When the platform discovers a compromised credentials cache, it will notify you if any of your users were compromised. Those users will be locked out until they change their passwords, so attackers can't use their compromised passwords against you in a credential stuffing attack.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size:160%;font-weight: bold">
         Guard Against Attacks
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Teaching your workforce how to spot malicious emails is a project you must take seriously and update frequently. As phishing attacks get more sophisticated, they become harder to spot, and the only way to combat this threat is to keep your staff informed.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         Attacks involving broken authentication can compromise not only your data but also crash your site. Traffic can spike by 180x during a credential stuffing attack, so brute-force protection is an absolute must to stay online. It works by limiting the number of times a specific IP address can attempt to log in, so bots can’t flood your system.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">
         A sophisticated IAM system doesn’t look at just logins and session IDs to determine whether a user is legitimate or malicious. It should also flag other types of suspicious behavior. Anomaly detection will alert you if, for instance, an employee logs off at 10 p.m. in North America and logs back on at 3 a.m. in Bangladesh.
